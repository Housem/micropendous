#summary Open Hardware Development Board for the AT90USB162

Micropendous1 is an Open Hardware Development Board for Atmel's [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?PN=AT90USB162 AT90USB162] USB AVR Microcontroller.

The relevant [http://www.lis.inpg.fr/realise_au_lis/kicad/ KiCAD] design files can be found in the latest [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/downloads/list Micropendous Distribution] or via [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/source/checkout SVN] in the `/Micropendous/Design/Micropendous1` directory.

== Features ==
  * Based on the [http://www.atmel.com Atmel] [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?PN=AT90USB162 AT90USB162] USB AVR Microcontroller
  * USB Full Speed (12Mbit/s)
  * USB Device Mode
  * 12kb of available FLASH memory for your programs (4kb used by USB bootloader - stock Atmel or [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/source/browse/trunk/Micropendous/Firmware/BootloaderDFU LUFA])
  * 512 bytes SRAM, 512 bytes of EEPROM
  * USB powered
  * 8MHz crystal (16MHz version also possible but must run at 5V)
  * 21 General Purpose IO Pins
  * !Vcc_Sel jumper selects 5V or 3.3V operation and powers external devices through Vcc pins (500mA at 5V, 50mA at 3.3V)
  * RESET and HWB buttons to enable firmware loading over USB (no external programmer required)
  * HWB can be used as a user button
  * standard USB Mini-B connector
  * Size LxWxH (including headers): 1.25" x 0.8" x 0.6" =~ 3.2cm x 2cm x 1.5cm
  * completely OpenHardware Design, schematic/layout/!BillOfMaterials/assembly instructions available for Open Source [http://www.lis.inpg.fr/realise_au_lis/kicad/ KiCAD]
  * works with Open Source [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA] USB firmware library and Open Source [http://libusb.sourceforge.net LibUSB] software library, or with Open Source [http://pyserial.wiki.sourceforge.net/pySerial PySerial] library if using USBtoSerial or CDC based firmware.
  * [http://www.linux.org/ Linux] + [http://gcc.gnu.org/ AVR-GCC] + [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA] + [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA Bootloader] + [http://kicad.sourceforge.net KiCAD] + [http://dfu-programmer.sourceforge.net/ DFU-Programmer] allow you to develop Open Source and/or Open Hardware projects around Micropendous boards without ever touching proprietary software.

== !QuickNotes ==
 * the !Vcc_Sel jumper should *ALWAYS* be in place.  Board may be damaged if you remove the jumper while the board is powered.
 * at 3.3V the AT90USB162's internal regulator is used which can supply at most 50mA to external devices
 * *DO NOT* connect *GND* and *VCC*.  This will short your computer's USB power supply and may damage your computer and your Micropendous1
 * to start the bootloader, plug in your board and press both the RESET and HWB buttons, then release RESET, then HWB
 * Due to the open construction of the board, do not use it on any conductive surface as it may create short circuits
 * the RESET pin is accessible on the outer header to enable programming of the bootloader with an AVR ISP programmer such as [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA]'s AVRISP firmware
 * PD7 (HWB) is pulled up to Vcc with a 47k resistor to disable the bootloader under normal operation.  This may influence your design decisions and usage of PD7.  Be careful this pin is not Low during RESET/START-UP or the board will enter the bootloader.
 * observe precautions for electrostatic sensitive components while handling the board
 * if your board has a communication error after being plugged in, press RESET
 * you may need to edit the `makefile` before compiling LUFA or Micropendous firmware demos.  The four key variables you need to be mindful of are:
{{{
MCU = at90usb162
BOARD  = USER
F_CPU = 8000000
}}}
