== !QuickNotes ==
 * *DO NOT* connect *GND* and *VCC*.  This will short your computer's USB power supply and may damage your computer and your Micropendous-A
 * to start the bootloader, plug in your board and press both the RESET and HWB buttons, then release RESET, then HWB
 * Due to the open construction of the board, do not use it on any conductive surface as it may create short circuits
 * PE2 (HWB) is pulled up to Vcc with a 43k resistor to disable the bootloader under normal operation.  This may influence your design decisions and usage of PE2.  Be careful this pin is not Low during RESET/START-UP or the board will enter the bootloader.
 * to power the board externally when USB Hosting, simply provide regulated 4.5V-5.5V power to the board through the VBUS or VCC pins (VBUS=VCC)
 * to power the board externally at other IO voltages, simply cut the VBUS=VCC trace jumper on the underside of the board and provide regulated 3V-5.5V power to the board through the VCC pin and regulated 4.5V-5.5V power to the board through the VBUS pin.  The VBUS pin is always connected to the USB connector power rail so do not provide VBUS if the board is connected to a USB Host.  Only connect power to the VBUS pin when the board is the USB Host.  Note that operation at 16MHz and/or use of the external SRAM requires 4.5V-5.5V VCC.
 * observe precautions for electrostatic sensitive components while handling the board
 * if your board has a communication error after being plugged in, press RESET
 * you may need to edit the `makefile` before compiling Micropendous firmware demos.  The three key variables you need to be mindful of are:
{{{
MCU = at90usb1287
BOARD  = USER
F_CPU = 16000000
}}}
 * you can enable pins PF4,5,6,7 by disabling JTAG via software. Place the following code near the top of your `main()`:
{{{
    /* disable JTAG to allow corresponding pins to be used */
    #if ((defined(__AVR_AT90USB1287__) || defined(__AVR_AT90USB647__) ||  \
            defined(__AVR_AT90USB1286__) || defined(__AVR_AT90USB646__) ||  \
            defined(__AVR_ATmega16U4__)  || defined(__AVR_ATmega32U4__) ||  \
            defined(__AVR_ATmega32U6__)))
        // note the JTD bit must be written twice within 4 clock cycles to disable JTAG
        // you must also set the IVSEL bit at the same time, which requires IVCE to be set first
        // port pull-up resistors are enabled - PUD(Pull Up Disable) = 0
        MCUCR = (1 << JTD) | (1 << IVCE) | (0 << PUD);
        MCUCR = (1 << JTD) | (0 << IVSEL) | (0 << IVCE) | (0 << PUD);
    #endif
}}}

== Power Supply Design ==

The power supply follows _Figure 21-3_ of the [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc7593.pdf Datasheet] by default and _Figure 21-4_ with the `VBUS=VCC` `JP1` trace cut and the board powered externally through the `VCC` pin.

== Powering the board externally ==

A Micropendous-A board can be externally powered through its VCC pin (regardless whether it is connected to a USB Host).  Simply remove the VCC=VBUS trace jumper on the underside of the board to disconnect VBUS from VCC then power the board with an external regulated 3.1V to 5V power supply through the VCC pin.

http://micropendous.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Micropendous/Design/Micropendous3/Micropendous3_ExternalPower.jpg

== Modifying the board for 3.3V IO ==

Use a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_tool rotary tool] with an [http://www.dremel.com/en-us/Accessories/Pages/ProductDetail.aspx?pid=107 engraving cutter] to remove the PCB trace linking VBUS to VCC on the underside of the board.  Then solder a [http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/XC6222B331MR-G/893-1143-1-ND XC6222 SOT-235] or similar 3.3V voltage regulator into the unpopulated footprint.

If you decide to go back to 5V operation you will need to [http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/SMD1NL/SMD1NL-ND desolder] the 3.3V regulator and install a [http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/951102-8622-AR/3M9321-ND 2-pin 2mm header] and [http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/SPN02SYBN-RC/S3404-ND 2mm jumper].

== Hosting USB Devices ==

The board needs to be powered externally with a regulated 5V power supply through the VBUS pin to allow USB Hosting:

A [http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/A-USB-4-R/AE1474-ND USB A-A Adapter] is needed if your Micropendous-A has a USB-A Plug connector.

== Removing your Micropendous-A from a Breadboard ==

Be careful when removing your Micropendous-A from a Breadboard.  Use a mini screwdriver to pry one corner, then another, then another, then start from the first, etc...  It should take you about 20 or so careful corner nudges before the Micropendous-A will separate from a breadboard.  Be careful not to damage the SRAM IC.
