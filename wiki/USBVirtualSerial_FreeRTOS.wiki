#summary Communicate with Micropendous board using Serial Port software and techniques

Partial Draft!

The latest version of this firmware is available in the latest [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/downloads/list Micropendous Distribution] or via [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/source/checkout SVN] in the `/Micropendous/Firmware/USBVirtualSerial_FreeRTOS` directory.

USBVirtualSerial_FreeRTOS combines the [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA] USB library with the preemptive [http://www.freertos.org/ FreeRTOS] kernel to enable programming Micropendous boards without worrying about USB.  All USB functionality is hidden.  The preemptive FreeRTOS kernel allows for multitasking user code and LUFA USB functions.

* Status: * _Working_.  Please post any problems you encounter to the [http://groups.google.com/group/Micropendous Micropendous Group].

*USB Mode*: Device-mode enumerating as USB Virtual Serial

* Targets: * Micropendous2, Micropendous3, or Micropendous4, or other USB AVR boards with more than 2kbytes of SRAM.

== Usage ==

Assuming you have completed all setup tasks in the [QuickStart] tutorial, simply compile and upload the USBVirtualSerial firmware onto your Micropendous.

USBVirtualSerial-programmed devices will enumerate as a Virtual Serial Port and any data sent to the device will be echoed back.
