#summary Communicate with Micropendous board using Serial Port software and techniques

Partial Draft!

The latest version of this firmware is available in the latest [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/downloads/list Micropendous Distribution] or via [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/source/checkout SVN] in the `/Micropendous/Firmware/USBVirtualSerial_FreeRTOS` directory.

*Purpose:* USBVirtualSerial_FreeRTOS combines the [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA] USB library with the preemptive [http://www.freertos.org/ FreeRTOS] kernel to enable programming Micropendous boards without worrying about USB.  All USB functionality is hidden.  The preemptive FreeRTOS kernel allows for multitasking user code and LUFA USB functions.

*USB Mode:* Device-mode enumerating as USB Virtual Serial Port

*Targets:* Micropendous2, Micropendous3, or Micropendous4, or other USB AVR boards with more than 2kbytes of SRAM.

*Status:* _Working_.  Please post any problems you encounter to the [http://groups.google.com/group/Micropendous Micropendous Group].

== Usage ==

Assuming you have completed all setup tasks in the [QuickStart] tutorial, simply compile and upload the USBVirtualSerial-FreeRTOS firmware onto your Micropendous by following the [ProgramAndTest] tutorial.

USBVirtualSerial-FreeRTOS programmed devices will enumerate as a Virtual Serial Port and any data sent to the device using [Serial] will be echoed back.

== Firmware Design ==

This firmware is based on [USBVirtualSerial].  The preemptive [http://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS] kernel was added to allow multi-tasking and hide USB functionality from the programmer.  Standard `stdin` and `stdout/stderr` streams are created in `main()` and linked to the USB Virtual Serial Port.  This means you can use standard `printf` and `getchar` functions to read and write data over the USB connection.  Just place your code in `Main_Task()`.  See [http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__stdio.html avr-libc stdio] for detailed instructions on using these functions.

On the host side, `serialpy.py` is an example of serial communication and is explained in [Serial].

_Note:_ DO NOT alter Timer1 settings as it is used by FreeRTOS.

{{{
/* Main_Task will run at lowest priority once initialization is complete */
void Main_Task(void)
{
  int localTempByte = 0;  // temporary storage - integer (16-bit)

  // If the host has sent data then process it - need this to prevent busy-looping
  while (haveData()) {
      // store data temporarily then send it right back - raw binary
      localTempByte = getData(stdin); // store received binary data
      sendData(localTempByte, stdout); // send binary data back

      // How to use printf functions to send and receive text:
      // printf_P(PSTR("\r\nUSBVirtualSerial\r\n")); // send a string that is constant and stored in FLASH
      // localTempByte = getchar(); // receive a character
      // printf("Received char = %3d\r\n", localTempByte); // send a string that is dynamic and stored in SRAM
  }
}
}}}

The above example is very simple.  `haveData()` checks if data exists and then `getData()` and `sendData()` send it back over the USB serial connection.

Commented out are `printf()` and `getchar()` functions which perform the same task.  Note that `printf()` is stored entirely in SRAM so it is best to use `printf_P(PSTR("...");` to store any constant strings.
