#summary USB Virtual Serial to UART Interface

The latest version of this firmware is available in the latest [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/downloads/list Micropendous Distribution] or via [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/source/checkout SVN] in the `/Micropendous/Firmware/USBtoSerial` directory.

*Purpose:* Communicate with other electronic devices over the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver/transmitter UART] interface.

*Targets*: [Micropendous1], [Micropendous2], [Micropendous3], [Micropendous4] or any USB AVR based hardware

*USB Mode:* Device-mode enumerating as USB Virtual Serial Port

*Status*: _Working_

== Usage ==

Compile and load USBtoSerial firmware onto your USB AVR by following the [ProgramAndTest] tutorial.

Connections to other devices are as follows:

|| *Micropendous* || *UART* ||
|| PD2 _(RXD1)_   || RX ||
|| PD3 _(TXD1)_   || TX ||
|| GND            || GND ||

== Testing ==

Create a loopback by connecting PD2 _(RXD1)_ and PD3 _(TXD1)_ (the picture below is incorrect but you get the idea).

Follow the instructions in [Serial] to connect to the device using a serial terminal and any characters you type will be looped back but only while the loopback wire is in place.
