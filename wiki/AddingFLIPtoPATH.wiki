#summary Adding Atmel FLIP Directories to Windows' PATH

*PATH* is a list of directories Windows searches in for programs when you attempt to run a program in a _Command Prompt_.  Each directory is separated with a semicolon `;`.

You may need to be logged in as Administrator to perform the following.

 # Get to _System Properties_.  You can either right-click on _My Computer_ and click _Properties_, or you can go to _Start_, then _Control Panel_, then _System_.
 # Select the _Advanced_ tab and click _Environment Variables_.
 # Double-click *PATH* under _System Variables_
 # Add `;C:\Program Files\Atmel\Flip 3.3.4\bin` to the end of the list in _Variable Value_.  This value will be different if you installed WinAVR somewhere else.

Here is an over-lapped picture of the above:
