#summary Using Micropendous boards with Arduino1

*Current Status*: _2011-11-01_ : The Arduino1 Diskloader Bootloader is being ported [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/source/browse/trunk/Micropendous/Firmware/Arduino1_Bootloader/ ported] to the AT90USB1287.

== Programming the Arduino1 Bootloader into a Micropendous Board ==

You will need some sort of AVR Programmer.  If you have another USB AVR board such as the [Micropendous_32U2 ] you can load it with [AVRISP] firmware and use it to program your [Micropendous] board.  If you already have a programmer then the `avrdude` command should look something like the following.  You may need to change the `-P` _port_ option and the `-c` _programmer_ option.  Note there is a copy of `avrdude` in the `/arduino-1.0-rc2/hardware/tools/avr/bin/` directory.

avrdude -vvv -P usb -c avrispmkII -p at90usb1287 -U flash:w:DiskLoader_Micropendous_Rev2_Working.hex
}}}

To use another USB AVR board for programming, download the latest version of the [http://www.lufa-lib.org/ LUFA] library and follow the [ProgramAndTest] instructions to load AVRISP-MKII firmware found in `LUFA/Projects/AVRISP-MKII` onto your board.

Connect your USB AVR board to your Micropendous board according to the [AVRISP] instructions.

The following assumes you have prepared your computer for compiling USB AVR code according to the [QuickStart] instructions.

Now download the [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/downloads/detail?name=Arduino1_Bootloader_for_AT90USB1287-2011-10-31.zip Arduino1 Diskloader] firmware and program your Micropendous board.

Under Linux you may need to run the `make program` command as root.

Under Windows you will need to start a _Command Prompt_ and run `make` then `make program`:
