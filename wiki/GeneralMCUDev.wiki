The latest version of this firmware is available in the latest [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/downloads/list Micropendous Distribution] or via [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/source/checkout SVN] in the `/Micropendous/Firmware/GeneralMCUDev` directory.

*Purpose:* Use a USB AVR like a non-USB microcontroller.  It is easy to program using the USB bootloader which simplifies development.  Each USB AVR has functionality similar to a non-USB AVR.

*Source Code:* [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/source/browse/trunk/Micropendous/Firmware/GeneralMCUDev View] or [http://www.Micropendous.org/Distribution Download]

*Targets:* [Micropendous1], [Micropendous2], [Micropendous3], [Micropendous4] or any USB AVR based hardware

*USB Mode:* No USB functionality.

*Status:* _DRAFT_

= Usage =

Compile and load the GeneralMCUDev firmware onto your USB AVR by following the [ProgramAndTest] tutorial.


= Code =

The code is very basic.  Simply disable the USB interface.

    /* disable USB */       
    USBCON = ((0 << USBE) | (1 << FRZCLK));
    PRR1 |= (PRUSB);
