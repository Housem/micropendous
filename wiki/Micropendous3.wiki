#summary Open Hardware Development Board for the AT90USB646

Micropendous3 is an Open Hardware Development Board for Atmel's [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?PN=AT90USB646 AT90USB646] USB AVR Microcontroller.

The relevant [http://www.lis.inpg.fr/realise_au_lis/kicad/ KiCAD] design files can be found in the latest [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/downloads/list Micropendous Distribution] or via [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/source/checkout SVN] in the `/Micropendous/Design/Micropendous3` directory.

== Features ==

  * Based on the [http://www.atmel.com Atmel] [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?PN=AT90USB646 AT90USB646] USB AVR Microcontroller
  * USB Full Speed (12Mbit/s)
  * USB Device Mode
  * 60kb of available FLASH memory for your programs (4kb used by USB bootloader - stock Atmel or [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/source/browse/trunk/Micropendous/Firmware/BootloaderDFU LUFA])
  * 4 kbytes SRAM, 2 kbytes of EEPROM, external SRAM is possible
  * USB powered
  * 8MHz crystal (16MHz version also possible but must run at 5V)
  * 48 General Purpose IO Pins (47 with external SRAM)
  * !Vcc_Sel jumper selects 5V or 3.3V operation and powers external devices through Vcc pins (500mA at 5V, 500mA at 3.3V)
  * RESET and HWB buttons to enable firmware loading over USB (no external programmer required)
  * HWB can be used as a user button
  * standard USB Mini-B connector
  * JTAG header (must be populated with a [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=609-3243-ND 0.1" 5x2 header]) for debugging or bootloader update and all JTAG pins except RESET are also accessible on the outer 0.1" headers
  * Size LxWxH (including headers): 2.84" x 0.8" x 0.6" =~ 7.2cm x 2cm x 1.5cm
  * completely OpenHardware Design, schematic/layout/!BillOfMaterials/assembly instructions available for Open Source [http://www.lis.inpg.fr/realise_au_lis/kicad/ KiCAD]
  * works with Open Source [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA] USB firmware library and Open Source [http://libusb.sourceforge.net LibUSB] software library, or with Open Source [http://pyserial.wiki.sourceforge.net/pySerial PySerial] library if using USBtoSerial or CDC based firmware.
  * [http://www.linux.org/ Linux] + [http://gcc.gnu.org/ AVR-GCC] + [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA] + [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA Bootloader] + [http://kicad.sourceforge.net KiCAD] + [http://dfu-programmer.sourceforge.net/ DFU-Programmer] allow you to develop Open Source and/or Open Hardware projects around a Micropendous3 without ever touching proprietary software.

== !QuickNotes ==
 * the !Vcc_Sel jumper should *ALWAYS* be in place.  Board may be damaged if you remove the jumper while the board is powered.
 * the board's 3.3V regulator outputs 3.3V +/- 5% up to 500mA
 * *DO NOT* connect *GND* and *VCC*.  This will short your computer's USB power supply and may damage your computer and your Micropendous3
 * to start the bootloader, plug in your board and press both the RESET and HWB buttons, then release RESET, then HWB
 * Due to the open construction of the board, do not use it on any conductive surface as it may create short circuits
 * PE2 (HWB) is pulled up to Vcc with a 47k resistor to disable the bootloader under normal operation.  This may influence your design decisions and usage of PE2.  Be careful this pin is not Low during RESET/START-UP or the board will enter the bootloader.
 * observe precautions for electrostatic sensitive components while handling the board
 * if your board has a communication error after being plugged in, press RESET
 * you may need to edit the `makefile` before compiling LUFA or Micropendous firmware demos.  The four key variables you need to be mindful of are:
{{{
MCU = at90usb646
BOARD  = USER
F_CPU = 8000000
}}}
you can enable pins PF4,5,6,7 by disabling JTAG via software. Place the following code near the top of `main()`:
{{{
    /* disable JTAG to allow corresponding pins to be used */
    #if ((defined(__AVR_AT90USB1287__) || defined(__AVR_AT90USB647__) ||  \
            defined(__AVR_AT90USB1286__) || defined(__AVR_AT90USB646__) ||  \
            defined(__AVR_ATmega16U4__)  || defined(__AVR_ATmega32U4__) ||  \
            defined(__AVR_ATmega32U6__)))
        // note the JTD bit must be written twice within 4 clock cycles to disable JTAG
        // you must also set the IVSEL bit at the same time, which requires IVCE to be set first
        // port pull-up resistors are enabled - PUD(Pull Up Disable) = 0
        MCUCR = (1 << JTD) | (1 << IVCE) | (0 << PUD);
        MCUCR = (1 << JTD) | (0 << IVSEL) | (0 << IVCE) | (0 << PUD);
    #endif
}}}

== Removing your Micropendous3 from a Breadboard ==

Be careful when removing your Micropendous3 from a Breadboard.  Make sure not to damage the SRAM IC.  Use a mini screwdriver to pry one corner, then another, then another, etc...  It should take you about 20 or so careful corner nudges before the Micropendous3 will separate from a breadboard.
