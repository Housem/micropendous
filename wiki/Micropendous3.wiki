== Features ==

  * Based on the 64-pin USB AVR Microcontrollers: [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?PN=AT90USB646 AT90USB646], [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?PN=AT90USB647 AT90USB647], [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?PN=AT90USB1286 AT90USB1286], or [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?PN=AT90USB1287 AT90USB1287].
  * USB Full Speed (12Mbit/s)
  * USB Device Mode (Host mode supported with AT90USBxx7 devices)
  * 60kb (AT90USB64) or 120kb (AT90USB128) of available FLASH memory for your programs (4kb(AT90USB64)/8kb(AT90USB128) used by USB bootloader - stock Atmel or [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/source/browse/trunk/Micropendous/Firmware/BootloaderDFU LUFA])
  * 4 kbytes SRAM and 2 kbytes of EEPROM (AT90USB64) or 8 kbytes SRAM and 4 kbytes of EEPROM (AT90USB128)
  * [http://www.Micropendous.org/SRAM external SRAM] is possible
  * USB powered
  * 16MHz crystal
  * 48 General Purpose IO Pins (47 with external SRAM)
  * Vcc=VBUS jumper selects whether USB VBUS or an external supply is used to power the board
  * RESET and HWB buttons to enable firmware loading over USB (no external programmer required)
  * HWB can be used as a user button
  * USB-A Plug
  * JTAG header (must be populated with a [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=609-3243-ND 0.1" 5x2 header]) for debugging or bootloader update
  * Size LxWxH (including headers): 3.15" x 0.8" x 0.6" =~ 8cm x 2cm x 1.5cm
  * completely OpenHardware Design, schematic/layout/!BillOfMaterials/assembly instructions available for Open Source [http://www.lis.inpg.fr/realise_au_lis/kicad/ KiCAD]
  * works with Open Source [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA] USB firmware library and Open Source [http://libusb.sourceforge.net LibUSB] software library, or with Open Source [http://pyserial.wiki.sourceforge.net/pySerial PySerial] library if using USBtoSerial or CDC based firmware.
  * [http://www.linux.org/ Linux] + [http://gcc.gnu.org/ AVR-GCC] + [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA] + [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA Bootloader] + [http://kicad.sourceforge.net KiCAD] + [http://dfu-programmer.sourceforge.net/ DFU-Programmer] allow you to develop Open Source and/or Open Hardware projects around a Micropendous3 without ever touching proprietary software.

== !QuickNotes ==
 * *DO NOT* connect *GND* and *VCC*.  This will short your computer's USB power supply and may damage your computer and your Micropendous3
 * to start the bootloader, plug in your board and press both the RESET and HWB buttons, then release RESET, then HWB
 * Due to the open construction of the board, do not use it on any conductive surface as it may create short circuits
 * PE2 (HWB) is pulled up to Vcc with a 47k resistor to disable the bootloader under normal operation.  This may influence your design decisions and usage of PE2.  Be careful this pin is not Low during RESET/START-UP or the board will enter the bootloader.
 * observe precautions for electrostatic sensitive components while handling the board
 * if your board has a communication error after being plugged in, press RESET
 * you may need to edit the `makefile` before compiling LUFA or Micropendous firmware demos.  The three key variables you need to be mindful of are:
{{{
MCU = at90usb647
BOARD  = USER
F_CPU = 16000000
}}}
you can enable pins PF4,5,6,7 by disabling JTAG via software. Place the following code near the top of `main()`:
{{{
    /* disable JTAG to allow corresponding pins to be used */
    #if ((defined(__AVR_AT90USB1287__) || defined(__AVR_AT90USB647__) ||  \
            defined(__AVR_AT90USB1286__) || defined(__AVR_AT90USB646__) ||  \
            defined(__AVR_ATmega16U4__)  || defined(__AVR_ATmega32U4__) ||  \
            defined(__AVR_ATmega32U6__)))
        // note the JTD bit must be written twice within 4 clock cycles to disable JTAG
        // you must also set the IVSEL bit at the same time, which requires IVCE to be set first
        // port pull-up resistors are enabled - PUD(Pull Up Disable) = 0
        MCUCR = (1 << JTD) | (1 << IVCE) | (0 << PUD);
        MCUCR = (1 << JTD) | (0 << IVSEL) | (0 << IVCE) | (0 << PUD);
    #endif
}}}

== Powering the board externally ==

A Micropendous3 board can be externally powered through its VCC pin (regardless whether it is connected to a USB Host).  Simply remove the VCC=VBUS jumper to disconnect VBUS from VCC then power the board with an external regulated 5V power supply.

== Hosting USB Devices ==

If a Micropendous3 board is populated with the [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?PN=AT90USB647 AT90USB647] or [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?PN=AT90USB1287 AT90USB1287] then it is able to host USB devices with the aid of a [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=AE1474-ND USB plug adapter].  The board will need to be powered externally with a regulated 5V power supply.

== Removing your Micropendous3 from a Breadboard ==

Be careful when removing your Micropendous3 from a Breadboard.  Use a mini screwdriver to pry one corner, then another, then another, then start from the first, etc...  It should take you about 20 or so careful corner nudges before the Micropendous3 will separate from a breadboard.
