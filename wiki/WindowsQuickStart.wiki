#summary Setting up a firmware development environment in Windows

A version of this page for Linux is also [LinuxQuickStart available].

In general, *Administrator* privileges are required on a Windows machine during development.  The easiest thing to do is to log in as Administrator during development.  This creates security issues so it is best disconnect from the Internet when not using it.  Also, having a separate computer for development is preferable in case you incorrectly connect something and fry your system.
