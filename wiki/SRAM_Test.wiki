#summary Test the External SRAM on a board which supports it

DRAFT!

The latest version of this firmware is available in the latest [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/downloads/list Micropendous Distribution] or via [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/source/checkout SVN] in the `/Micropendous/Firmware/SRAM_Test` directory.

SRAM_Test uses the [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA] USB library to send random bytes of data to a Micropendous4 board's SRAM then checks to make sure it is read back correctly.  The firmware also runs internal SRAM tests.
