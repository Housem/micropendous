== Usage ==

Compile and load the Micropendous firmware onto your USB AVR by following the [ProgramAndTest] tutorial.

Just as with [MicropendousKeyboardTest], GND'ing pins will type their name.  Also, you can use the techniques in [Serial] to communicate with the board, which is programmed to loop back any data.

== Firmware Design ==

[LUFAduino] and [MicropendousKeyboardTest] mashed together.  An elaborated explanation will follow when the firmware attains stable and cross-platform functionality.
