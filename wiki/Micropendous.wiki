#summary LUFAduino and HID Keyboard for Compound Device Testing

The latest version of this firmware is available in the latest [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/downloads/list Micropendous Distribution] or via [http://code.google.com/p/micropendous/source/checkout SVN] in the `/Micropendous/Firmware/Micropendous` directory.

*Purpose:* Combine [LUFAduino] with [MicropendousKeyboardTest] to allow both Serial communication and Keyboard testing of a Micropendous board.

*Targets:* [Micropendous2], [Micropendous3], [Micropendous4] or any USB AVR based hardware with 2kb+ of SRAM

*USB Mode:* Device-mode enumerating as Compound USB Device -  USB Virtual Serial Port and HID Keyboard

*Status:* Works under Windows, fails under Linux.  Still under development.


== Usage ==

Compile and load the Micropendous firmware onto your USB AVR by following the [ProgramAndTest] tutorial.

Just as with [MicropendousKeyboardTest], GND'ing pins will type their name.  Also, you can use the techniques in [Serial] to communicate with the board, which is programmed to loop back any data.

== Firmware Design ==

[LUFAduino] and [MicropendousKeyboardTest] mashed together.  An elaborated explanation will follow when the firmware attains stable and cross-platform functionality.
