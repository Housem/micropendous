  * [http://www.linux.org/ Linux] + [http://gcc.gnu.org/ AVR-GCC] + [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA] + [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA Bootloader] + [http://kicad.sourceforge.net KiCAD] + [http://dfu-programmer.sourceforge.net/ DFU-Programmer] allow you to develop Open Source and/or Open Hardware projects around a Micropendous-DIP board without ever touching proprietary software.

== !QuickNotes ==
 * *DO NOT* connect *GND* and *VCC*.  This will short your computer's USB power supply and may damage your computer and your Micropendous board
 * important pins: *PE3* controls TXB0108 `OE` pin, *PE6* is USB-A over-current flag, *PE4* is SRAM `nCE`, *PE5* is SRAM address bit 17, and *PE7* controls USB switch with USB-B=`0` and USB-A=`1`.
 * to start the bootloader, plug in your board and press both the RESET and HWB buttons, then release RESET, then release HWB
 * Due to the open construction of the board, do not use it on any conductive surface as it may create short circuits
 * PE2 (HWB) is pulled up to Vcc with a 47k resistor to disable the bootloader under normal operation.  This may influence your design decisions and usage of PE2.  Be careful this pin is not Low during RESET/START-UP or the board will enter the bootloader.
 * observe precautions for electrostatic sensitive components while handling the board
 * if your board has a communication error after being plugged in, press RESET
 * you may need to edit the `makefile` before compiling LUFA or Micropendous firmware demos.  The three key variables you need to be mindful of are:
{{{
MCU = at90usb1287
F_CPU = 16000000
BOARD = MICROPENDOUS
