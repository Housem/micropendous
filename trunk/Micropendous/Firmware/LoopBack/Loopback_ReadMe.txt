Purpose: USB Custom Class device demonstration.  Communicate via
	 regular or control endpoints to loop back data.

Notes:	- as written it simply loops back any data sent from
	  the host.
	- look for TODO statements in LoopBack.c
	  most of your code should go in Main_Task() and
	  possibly SetupHardware()
