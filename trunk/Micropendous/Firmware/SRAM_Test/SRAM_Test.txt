 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  External SRAM testing and communication firmware.
 *  When programmed into a AT90USB64 or AT90USB128 USB AVR,
 *  the AVR will enumerate as a virtual COM port.
 *
 *  Connecting to the virtual COM port and sending an 'h' will
 *  list the communication protocol/help message.  
 *
 *  All communication is done at Full Speed USB (12Mbit/s) speed.
 *
 *  After running this project for the first time on a new computer,
 *  you will need to supply the .INF file located in this project
 *  project's directory as the device's driver when running under
 *  Windows. This will enable Windows to use its inbuilt CDC drivers,
 *  negating the need for custom drivers for the device. Other
 *  Operating Systems should automatically use their own inbuilt
 *  CDC-ACM drivers.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this project, which can control the project behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td><b>Define Name:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Location:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Description:</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>BUFF_STATICSIZE</td>
 *    <td>RingBuff.h</td>
 *    <td>Defines the maximum number of bytes which can be buffered in each Ring Buffer.</td>
