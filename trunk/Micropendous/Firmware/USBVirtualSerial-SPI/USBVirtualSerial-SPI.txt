 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  USBVirtualSerial-SPI Project. This project allows a USB AVR to emulate
 *  a serial port but communicate data over SPI.
 *  When programmed into a USB AVR, the AVR will enumerate as a
 *  virtual COM Port.
 *
 *  You can use the Virtual Serial Port's baud rate, parity, and other
 *  settings to control the application.  See USBVirtualSerial-SPI_ReadMe or
 *  USBVirtualSerial-SPI.c for more information.
 *
 *  After running this project for the first time on a new computer,
 *  you will need to supply the .INF file located in this project
 *  project's directory as the device's driver when running under
 *  Windows. This will enable Windows to use its inbuilt CDC drivers,
 *  negating the need for custom drivers for the device. Other
 *  Operating Systems should automatically use their own inbuilt
 *  CDC-ACM drivers.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this project, which can control the project behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td><b>Define Name:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Location:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Description:</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>BUFF_STATICSIZE</td>
 *    <td>RingBuff.h</td>
 *    <td>Defines the maximum number of bytes which can be buffered in each Ring Buffer.</td>
 *   </tr>
