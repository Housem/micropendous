 *  \section SSec_Compat Demo Compatibility:
 *
 *  The following table indicates what microcontrollers are compatible with this demo.
 *  More than 2kb of SRAM is required for this demo to function.
 *
 *  - AT90USB1287
 *  - AT90USB1286
 *  - AT90USB647
 *  - AT90USB646
 *  - ATMEGA32U6
 *  - ATMEGA32U4

 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Communications Device Class demonstration application.
 *  This gives a simple reference application for implementing
 *  a USB Virtual Serial device using the CDC class with syntax
 *  the same as the Arduino library.
 *
 *  Connecting to a device programmed with this firmware using
 *  a Serial Port Terminal will send back any text tou type as
 *  well as flash an LED connected to pin 8 - PD0.
 *
 *  After running this demo for the first time on a new computer,
 *  you will need to supply the .INF file located in this demo
 *  project's directory as the device's driver when running under
 *  Windows. This will enable Windows to use its inbuilt CDC drivers,
 *  negating the need for custom drivers for the device. Other
 *  Operating Systems should automatically use their own inbuilt
 *  CDC-ACM drivers.
