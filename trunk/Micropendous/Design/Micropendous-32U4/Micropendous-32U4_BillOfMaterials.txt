Open the design in KiCAD and CVpcb will list all footprints.

Micropendous-32U4_Assembly.svg shows component placement and values.

Notes:	- this board is designed for the ATMEGA32U4-AU, the TQFP version
	- 10uF capacitors are 0805 size and should be X5R +/-20% 10V or better
	- all capacitors and resistors are 0805 unless otherwise noted
	- precision components are noted as such, all other parts can be standard
	- 8MHz Crystal - HC49-US +/- 30ppm ~20pF load
	- the VCC_Sel Jumper and pins are DigiKey Part# S3404-ND, and 3M9322-ND
	- the microSD connector is the 3M 290805, DigiKey Part# 3M5607CT-ND
	- Schottky Rectifier Diode - MBR120VLSF or MBRX120 in SOD-123
	- Regulator - 1117-Adj in SOT223 - check your regulator's datasheet for best value of the 1206 tantalum capacitor
	- USB-A vertical connector can be DigiKey Part# 151-1114-ND or similar
	- USB-miniB can be DigiKey Part# H2959CT-ND or similar
	- all other components are standard or have no footprint variations
